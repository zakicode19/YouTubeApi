    "# USING AN API TO EXTRACT DATA FROM ANY YOUTUBE CHANNEL\n",
    "\n",
    "Last month, I came across this video [Python YouTube API Tutorial: Calculating the Duration of a Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coZbOM6E47I&t=16s). The video shows how to calculate the duration of any playlist on YouTube.  This video is part of a tutorial on the YouTube API. The video inspired me to work on my first personal data science project.  Even though the idea is simple, extract and analyze data from YouTube.   \n",
    "The first step of the project is to collect data for a specific YouTube channel by retrieving metric information from each video uploaded to that channel, then the data will be saved and stored to be used later without the need to run the script again.   \n",
    "The second part is to use data science tools to analyze the data and to get insights from it. We can look for the most popular videos on the channel, the most watched playlist, the relationship between duration and number of views, the relationship between video duration and number of comments, the ratio between likes and dislikes. We can ask all the questions we want and try to answer them as much as we can, given the complexity of the problem and we only have  access to public  data.\n"
