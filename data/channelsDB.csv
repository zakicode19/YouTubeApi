1,UCZUyPT9DkJWmS_DzdOi7RIA,Caleb Curry,"Programming Made Fun and Simple  

High quality tutorials that are fun, educational, and easy to follow.  Teaching programming is my passion!  I find joy in making complex material easy to understand.

I've decided that it is only right to upload videos of great quality and value.  Here you will find videos on C++, JavaScript, C, database design, SQL, and more!  As a side note, many videos contain horribly cheesy jokes and random stories...you've been warned.
